In 2019, ISCÂ² (International Information System Security Certification Consortium)
estimate that there will a shortfall of 1.5 million cyber security positions
worldwide. Pair this with GDPR and we think you'll agree that the demand for
cyber security professionals is huge!

But isn't this a tough field to get into? Luckily, Dean Coyle is here to help!
We'll be going through the range of resources available and the opportunities
that are waiting for you. We'll learn a little bit more about the Cyber Security
Challenge UK and how it's helped Dean in the field of security.

As always, we'll be at Campus North. Doors open at 6pm and pizza will be
supplied courtesy [Sharpe Recruitment](http://www.sharperecruitment.co.uk/) and
[Pebble](https://www.mypebble.co.uk). Don't forget to sign up below!

We're looking forward to seeing you there!
