## Doing a lot with a little

Python NE returns to our new home at The Core in Bath Lane with a
treat. [Jamie Curle](https://twitter.com/jamiecurle), of SoPost,
will be giving us an education in how Python can help us secure
our businesses and processes.

Traditionally, Information Security has been based on document and
people human heavy processes, which are implemented to form an
Information Security Management System (ISMS). Some parts of an
ISMS can seem a little antiquated when viewed through the eyes of
a programmer. In this talk we will look at how even very basic
python skills can open up opportunities to streamline the ISMS
procedures to make auditing easy and ensure policies are respected
with minimal humans or documentation.

As always, make sure you sign up soon so we can order enough pizza
and drinks for everyone. The venue is kindly supplied by
[SoPost](https://www.sopost.com/) and the pizza and drinks are
courtesy [Caspian](https://www.caspian.co.uk/) and
[Sharpe Recruitment](http://www.sharperecruitment.co.uk/).

We're looking forward to seeing you on 14th November at The Core!
