title: Python @ Twitter
link: https://attending.io/events/python-twitter
---

Tom spend his summer doing an internship @ Twitter in San Francisco. In this
talk he will give an overview of how Twitter works (as much as he is allowed to
say anyway), what Twitter uses Python for and what tools, packages and libraries it uses.
He will then discuss why he was there and the project (a big pile of Python code)
that he was working on.

This will hopefully be an informative talk with lots of discussion, there is no
need to bring a laptop, but do bring questions! It will be our last event at the
wonderful Campus North so please come and give the place a good send off!
