This month we are going to run an interactive session and take part
in an ongoing card game AI contest. If you've ever played Magic the
Gathering or Hearthstone, you will feel at home. With a deck of cards
we will summon creatures, attack enemies and use defensive and offensive
items to gain advantage over the opponents AI.

If you always wanted to participate in an AI contest but didn't know
where to start, this is the event for you. We will introduce the rules
of the game and starting from a very simple bot, fight our way through
the contest leagues, revealing more complexity on the way. We will make
many suggestions but leave the choice of the exact strategy to you, so
you can have fun playing the game in your unique style :)

All you will need, is a laptop with a decent browser. If your Python
powers are weak, worry not --- you can always team-up with someone more
experienced and learn a few things on the way.
