The 25th May deadline for GDPR may have passed but the work to remain compliant
is ongoing. With this in mind, we've brought you something topical for 12th
June's event.

The GDPR isn't just a chance to write word documents - programming chops can
also help out. Jamie from [SoPost](https://www.sopost.com/) will show how a
(very simple) tool they've written in Python called "Murphy" (Robocop reference)
helps SoPost ensure that every bit of data they capture on their platform is
accounted for and aligned with according to SoPost's Information Security and
Data Protection Governance.

As always, we'll be at Campus North. Doors open at 6pm and pizza will be
supplied courtesy [Sharpe Recruitment](http://www.sharperecruitment.co.uk/) and
[Pebble](https://www.mypebble.co.uk). Don't forget to sign up below!

We're looking forward to seeing you there!
