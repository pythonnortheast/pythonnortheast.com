This Wednesday, we have a special treat for those of you interested in deep
learning. We'll have Sunny discussing facial recognition and image searching.

We'll be seeing how, using a webcam, we can record video, recognise a person
and look them up online. If we have time, we'll also be seeing a simple face
swap and see if we can replicate those fun features we see in Facebook!

As always, we'll be in Campus North from 6pm. Pizza is supplied courtesy of
[Pebble](https://www.mypebble.co.uk) and
[Sharpe Recruitment](http://www.sharperecruitment).

Looking forward to seeing you there!
