## Seeing out 2018 by killing some elves

Python NE is seeing out 2018 with our traditional Xmas Elves live coding game! Bring your laptops to join in the festive fun.

If you want some advance practice, check out the code on Github and have a play. We'll be hosting a server for you to use and we'll provide all the address details on the night.

We'll be at The Core on Bath Lane from 6pm with pizza and drinks provided, courtesy of our amazing sponsors: Sharpe Recruitment, SoPost and Caspian! We're looking forward to seeing you there and seeing out the year!
