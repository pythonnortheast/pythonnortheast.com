Python NE returns for the final meet-up of 2017 and we’re going out with a bang!
Bring your laptops for a live workshop featuring the Great Elf Game. Our team
will help you get up and running with Python and start putting your name on our
live leaderboard. If you need any help in advance, please get in touch with
[our organisers](mailto:scott@pythonnortheast.com)

We’ll be hosted, as always, at Campus North in Carliol Square, Newcastle on 13th
December. Doors open from 6pm so get here early and we’ll welcome you with
friendly faces, pizza and a well-stocked fridge.

Pizza will be provided free of charge by Pebble and Sharpe Recruitment. Don’t
forget to sign up so we can order enough!
