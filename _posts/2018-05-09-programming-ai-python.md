This month, Pawe≈Ç Widera is running a tutorial on Artificial Intelligence in games.
We will learn how to write our own intelligent bot that will kick our backsides
at games :P

To keep things simple, we'll be targeting a particular variant of classic 2-player
pen and pencil games. The rules may be simple but the gameplay is pretty exciting!

The tutorial will introduce several heuristic search algorithms typically
used in game play, starting with a random search and greedy optimisation,
through MinMax and its variants, to the Monte Carlo searching. There
will be several demo programs to play with, and an open competition at
the end, so bring your own laptop.

Python beginners are welcome. If you don't feel comfortable on your own,
there will be several more experienced people who you can team up with.

Please bring your laptop and get yourself setup with Python and Java:

* Python 3 - for bots
* Java 1.8 (JRE) - for running the game environment

## Debian/Ubuntu

To install on Debian or Ubuntu, simply do:

```
sudo apt install python3 openjdk-8-jre
```
