## Something Similar, Something Different

Rowan Hargreaves returns to Python NE with his long-awaited Clojure for
Pythonistas talk.

Clojure is a dynamic, practical modern Lisp with an emphasis on functional
programming using immutable data by default. It has built-in language level
constructs for concurrency and parallelism. Like Python, it is a general-purpose
anguage but that is hosted on the JVM, CLR or JavaScript runtimes. Clojure aims
to reduce the incidental complexity of the program itself by allowing the
programmer to compose programs from simple building blocks while helping them to
solve messy, real-world problems.

In this talk, we will take a whirlwind tour of Clojure by comparing and
contrasting with Python. Hopefully, you will come away with a taste for travel
beyond Python-land, and take away some ideas that might improve your Python
programs.

## Change of Date

To avoid upsetting partners this Valentines Day, we've moved February's meet-up
to **Thursday 15th February**.

As ever, Sharpe Recruitment will be supplying the pizzas. Doors open
at 6pm Wednesday at the usual Campus North. We're looking forward to seeing you
there!
