## A look into the MicroPython powered Internet of Things

This month we've got something special: Jose Marcelino of PyCom is bringing us something extra special! In this talk we will explore how MicroPython is an increasing core part of the Internet of Things, going into mass produced low power devices in industry, agriculture and healthcare.

In this talk we will explore how MicroPython is an increasing core part of the Internet of Things,  going into mass produced low power devices in industry, agriculture and healthcare.

After a brief overview we'll take a deep dive into the practical aspects with hands-on session using Pycom devices to collect sensor data and send it over the latest and most popular long range low power (LPWAN) adio protocols: LoRa, Sigfox and LTE-M.

We hope that by the end you’ll be able to bring this experience into your own applications and create your own IoT devices.

We'll be at Campus North, as always, and our sponsors are Pebble and Sharpe
Recruitment. Looking forward to seeing you all there!
